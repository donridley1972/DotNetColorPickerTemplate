Installer provided.

Clarion 10 example app included.

You have two options:
* Vertically stacked
* Side by Side

The template will take care of the manifests and copy the applicable DLL's to your project's directory.

<b>GLOBAL SETTING "Generate Manifest" MUST BE SET TO TRUE</b>

** Please note that I cannot guarantee this will work on Clarion 8 and below.
