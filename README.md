# DotNetColorPickerTemplate

Installer provided.

Clarion 10 example app included.

You have two options:
* Vertically stacked
* Side by Side

The template will take care of the manifests and copy the applicable DLL's to your project's directory.

<b>GLOBAL SETTING "Generate Manifest" MUST BE SET TO TRUE</b>

** NOTE **

With Clarion 8, everything generates fine from the template, however, I cannot get the .NET control to display in the OLE control. C10 and C11.x work fine.
